# Implementation

This spell-checker consists of three primary files. In speller.c, I have implemented a program that spell-checks all the words in a text file by running them against a dictionary of words. The dictionary itself is loaded into a hash table in dictionary.c. Finally, the prototypes for the functions used in dictionary.c are declared in dictionary.h.
